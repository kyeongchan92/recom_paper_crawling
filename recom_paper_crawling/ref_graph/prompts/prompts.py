PAPER_COMPARE_PROMPT = """ðŸ”¹ Task Instruction
Determine whether A paper and B paper refer to the same research work. If they do, respond with "YES"; otherwise, respond with "NO".

When making this judgment, apply the following considerations:

ðŸ”¹ Considerations for Matching Papers
1. Title Matching (Minor Differences Allowed)
âœ… Match the papers even if:

The capitalization, punctuation, or spacing is slightly different.
Example: "GPT-4 Technical Report" vs. "Gpt-4 technical report" â†’ Match
There are minor wording differences that do not change the meaning.
Example: "Large-scale language model society" vs. "Large language model society" â†’ Match
ðŸš¨ Do NOT match the papers if:

The core meaning of the title is different.
Example: "GPT-4 Overview" vs. "GPT-3.5 Architecture" â†’ Not the same paper
2. Source Matching (Preprints, Conferences, Journals, DOI, URLs)
âœ… Match the papers even if:

One is an arXiv preprint, and the other is a published conference/journal version of the same research.
Example: arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.17760 â†’ NeurIPS 2023 proceedings link â†’ Same research work
The URLs are different but point to the same DOI, arXiv ID, or official publisher repository.
Example:
"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774"
"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/.../2303.08774"
â†’ Same paper
The conference/journal version is an extended version of an arXiv paper, unless there is major content divergence.
ðŸš¨ Do NOT match the papers if:

The DOI/arXiv ID is different, and there is no indication that one is a revision of the other.
One is from a completely different publisher (e.g., IEEE vs. ACL Anthology) without a clear link between them.
3. Author Name Variations (Abbreviations & Institutional Naming Allowed)
âœ… Match the papers even if:

Authors use initials instead of full names.
Example: "Guohao Li" vs. "G Li" â†’ Same author
Authors are listed differently between an arXiv preprint and a published paper.
Example: "OpenAI" vs. "J Achiam, S Adler, S Agarwal" â†’ Match if source matches
A company name is used instead of individual authors.
ðŸš¨ Do NOT match the papers if:

A completely different research group is listed.
The list of authors has no significant overlap.
4. Edition or Version Differences (Preprint vs. Published Paper)
âœ… Match the papers even if:

One version is an early preprint and the other is a peer-reviewed conference/journal version.
The published version contains minor updates or additional experiments but is still based on the same research.
ðŸš¨ Do NOT match the papers if:

The newer version substantially changes the research (e.g., different methodology, new experiments, different conclusions).
The preprint was not accepted by the listed conference/journal.
